Earlier today, I was asked if I could share

> Ideas for boardgames which work well for two people...

so I put on my thinking-cap and came up with a few ideas

## Co-Operative Games

If you're not wanting to go head-to-head with the second player you might want
to consider adding some co-operative games to your repertoire

<!-- new game block -->
{% assign name="Pandemic" %}
{% assign bggid="30549" %}
{% assign zatuname="pandemic-2013" %}
{% assign bgpid="12" %}
{% assign imageurl="/assets/img/blog/2020-03-27-good_for_two/" |append: zatuname |append: ".jpg" %}

This one's a timeless classic and seems very thematic at the time of writing.

2-4 players work together to conquer virulent diseases that have broken out
all over the world.

With two players you can send two specialists round the world fighting the
diseases, or maybe you want to control two specialists each to add more
special abilities in your fight to save the world.

{% include gameinfo.md bgggamename=name bgggameid=bggid zatuproduct=zatuname bgpricesid=bgpid %}

<!-- new game block -->
{% assign name="Flash Point: Fire Rescue" %}
{% assign bggid="100901" %}
{% assign zatuname="flash-point-fire-rescue-2nd-edition" %}
{% assign bgpid="398" %}
{% assign imageurl="/assets/img/blog/2020-03-27-good_for_two/" |append: zatuname |append: ".jpg" %}

Maybe you'd prefer to test your life-saving skills on a more localised level.
Why not try your hand at firefighting? Work together trying to save enough
people, or pets, before the building collapses around you.

The game has [numerous expansions](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100901/flash-point-fire-rescue/expansions)
but if you only get one, make sure to check out [Tragic
Events](https://www.board-game.co.uk/product/flash-point-tragic-events-expansion).
In our opinion this is a *must have* addition to the base game.

{% assign name="Flash Point: Tragic Events" %}

{% assign bgpid="29547" %}
{% include gameinfo.md bgggamename="Flash Point: Tragic Events" bgggameid=bggid zatuproduct=zatuname bgpricesid=bgpid %}

## Two Player Games

You could of course point your wallet towards some games designed specifically
for two players. Often these will be competetive, so watch out!

<!-- new game block -->
{% assign name="And Then We Held Hands" %}
{% assign bggid="153999" %}
{% assign zatuname="and-then-we-held-hands" %}
{% assign bgpid="16121" %}

### {{name}}

![image]({{imageurl}}){: class="imagedropshadow thumb-float-left" }

This is an abstract game where two players co-operate to try to find balance,
complete objectives, and reach the centre of the board.

Without any verbal communication, players take turns trying to complete the
current shared emotional objective.

Use your cards, or your partner's, but beware, if either of you are unable to
move the game ends and both players lose.

{% include gameinfo.md bgggamename=name bgggameid=bggid zatuproduct=zatuname bgpricesid=bgpid %}

<!-- new game block -->
{% assign name="Fog of Love" %}
{% assign bggid="175324" %}
{% assign zatuname="fog-of-love" %}
{% assign bgpid="18203" %}
{% assign imageurl="/assets/img/blog/2020-03-27-good_for_two/" |append: zatuname |append: ".jpg" %}
### {{name}}

![image]({{imageurl}}){: class="imagedropshadow thumb-float-left" }

<em>Fog of Love </em> is a tricky game to describe. Is it a game? Is it
role-playing? Is it story-telling? We think it's a blend of all three.

In the game two players will create two characters (one each) and play through
a number of scenarios, aiming to balance both the needs of your character, and
the relationship both characters are having in the game.

You're never quite sure how things will turn out, but the journey is often
full of laughs, and sometimes shocks, as you play out the lives of these two
fictional characters.

<!-- new game block -->
{% assign name="The Fox In The Forest" %}
{% assign bggid="221965" %}

{% assign bgpid="20494" %}

### {{name}}

![image]({{imageurl}}){: class="imagedropshadow thumb-float-left" }

This is a small card game where each player is trying to use normal ranked and
suited cards to win tricks, but also using special powers of the characters
on the cards to bend the rules in your favour.

Try to win more tricks than your opponent, but don't win too many! Getting
greedy and winning too many tricks will *lower* you score for the round!

You may also be interested in a co-operative version of the game - _The Fox in
the Forest Duet_ where you both work together to play tricks and move through
the forest.

Play a mythical showdown between _Thor_ and _Loki_ in this card game. Players
build up 4 rows of cards representing their armies and defences on the
battlefield. Defeat the other player, or find Odin's Crown/Ring to win the
game.

Star Realms if a deck-building game where each player attempts to reduce the
other player's Authority (score) to zero.

Combine cards in your play area to trigger special actions, more combat
strength, or more purchasing power.

If you are at all interested in this, there's a
[free-to-play (with in-app purchases for add-ons and expansions) digital version](https://www.starrealms.com/digital-game/)
available for
<i class="fab fa-steam"></i> _Steam_,
<i class="fab fa-apple"></i> _MacOS_,
<i class="fab fa-app-store-ios"></i> _iOS_
and
<i class="fab fa-android"></i> _Android_.

Another card game, this time you are competing with the other player to try to
mount the most profitable expeditions to the different sites represented by
the five different card suits.

On a players turn they must play one card, either to an expedition, or to the
appropriate discard pile; then draw one card, either from the deck, or the top
of one of the discard piles.

Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but not necessarily
consecutive.

Feeling lucky before you start an expedition? Up the ante by playing
multipliers for your score on that suit.

Highest score over three matches wins the game.

### {{name}}

![image]({{imageurl}}){: class="imagedropshadow thumb-float-left" }

Using pieces that resemble a game of Tetris, you are both competing to build
the most _aesthetic quilt_.

On your turn, purchase a piece and add it to your growing patchwork quilt. One
placed, the piece may not be moved. Can you fit them all together and make the
best use of space before (virtual) time runs out?

Best score wins, but don't be surprised if your first game leaves you with
negative scores!

Similar to this, you might also enjoy [Patchwork
Doodle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/264239/patchwork-doodle) where you
draw your shapes onto a grid on a piece of paper. If you go this route, you
should definitely invest in some coloured highlighters!

### {{name}}

![image]({{imageurl}}){: class="imagedropshadow thumb-float-left" }

On a small grid of nine street cards your role is to either evade _"capture"_
as Mr Jack, or to use Holmes, Watson and a dog (!) to eliminate other suspects
and estblish the real identity of the killer.

This game is a mixture of puzzle and hide'n'seek. It's quite good fun, but
might not be for those with a dislike of logical reasoning and puzzle solving.

There's also a
[digital version of the game](https://www.asmodee-digital.com/en/mr-jack-pocket/)
availiable for
<i class="fab fa-app-store-ios"></i> _iOS_
and
<i class="fab fa-android"></i> _Android_.

### Games That Work Well With 2-Players

<!-- new game block -->
{% assign name="Villagers" %}
{% assign bggid="241724" %}
{% assign zatuname="villagers-kickstarter-edition" %}
{% assign bgpid="26045" %}
{% assign imageurl="/assets/img/blog/2020-03-27-good_for_two/" |append: zatuname |append: ".jpg" %}
### {{name}}

![image]({{imageurl}}){: class="imagedropshadow thumb-float-left" }

The game supports two to five players. The game plays really well at all
player counts, so it's a nice one to have in the collection for when you have
more people available to play.

In the game players will be drafting cards to later build into their village,
with the aim of being the most prosperous at the end of the game.

Some cards chain together, leading to a high scoring villager at the top of
the chain. Other cards might allow you to draft more cards, or build more in
your village.

If you go this route try to either but the Kickstarter Bundle (Zatu sell
[this](https://www.board-game.co.uk/product/villagers-kickstarter-edition/)),
or grab the base game and expansion pack separately. It's roughly &pound;10
more, but well worth it.

### {{name}}

![image]({{imageurl}}){: class="imagedropshadow thumb-float-left" }

This is a logical deduction game for 2-4 players. An invisible suspect has
committed a crime and it's up to you to track them down based on the sounds
they make as they move around the board.

The suspect is managed by a (free) app, and players compete to claim the most
rewards.

<!-- new game block -->
{% assign name="Silver" %}
{% assign bggid="278553" %}

{% assign bgpid="30136" %}

### {{name}}

![image]({{imageurl}}){: class="imagedropshadow thumb-float-left" }

Everyone starts the game with 5 face-down cards, and no knowledge of any cards
around the table. Before the round starts each player is allowed to look at
two of their own cards.

Of a player's turn, they draw a card and either discard it to use its power,
or exchange it with one (or more) cards in their village.

Call for a vote when you think you have the fewest werewolves (points) in your
village. Lowest score wins the round.

Lowest total score after four rounds wins the game.

Each player starts the game with one card in hand, and on their turn they
"draw one, play one". When you play (discard) a card you must resolve the
special power of the card.

Elimate the other player(s) or have the highest value card when the draw deck
runs out, and earn a favour token. Earn enough favour tokens, and win the
game.

One to four players embark on a road trip along a zombie-infested Route 66.
Bid resources to determine who's going to get first choice on the encounters
revealed over 8 rounds.

Grab supplies, pick up "useful items" and but watch out for those zombies!

Be the last player left alive, or score the most victory points to win.

Currently available at the incredible low price of &pound;10.89 at Amazon!

Work together controlling a group of explorers working their way through
perilous environments, making best use of their resources, in an attempt to
reach the final destination - El Dorado.

This is a good co-operative venture, trying to make the best choices in bad
situations.

If you're not in the mood to co-operate there's a
[head-to-head](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/the-lost-expedition/head-to-head.php)
variation where players compete to be the first to reach the lost city.

If you like the idea, but prefer a different theme, the game has also been
released as [Judge Dredd: The Cursed Earth](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/240957/judge-dredd-cursed-earth).
There are some minor changes, but both games are essentially the same
gameplay, with different themes.
