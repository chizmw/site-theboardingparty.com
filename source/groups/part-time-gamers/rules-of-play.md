> What to expect and how to be a good gamer

## Event Organisation

Events are invite-only and are sent to members of the Part Time Gamers mailing
group.

Events invitations are sent as a calendar invitation. Attendance is confirmed
using {% include rollforgroup-link.md %}

{% include rollforgroup-link.md %} events are invitation-by-URL.

### Capacity
Members of the group take it in turns to host sessions. It is up to the host
to decide the number of people that they have space for at their home.

Due to limited space sessions can only host gamers on a first-come-first-served basis.

### Food &amp; Drink

The session host has traditionally provided a main meal for the session
(_e.g.  stew, casserole, pasta, lasagne, &hellip;_).
They also offer drinks of their choice
(_e.g. tea, coffee, water, squash, &hellip;_)

Guests bring snacks, and any "special" food &amp; drink that would be
unreasonable to expect the host to provide.

## On The Day
Hosts usually accept visitors from 12-13:00 on the day of the session. Times
will vary so check the event for details.

### Schedule

A good schedule for the session is:

- <i class="fad fa-route"></i> Arrival / <i class="fal fa-comments-alt"></i> Catch-Up
- <i class="fal fa-rabbit-fast"></i> Quick Filler Game(s)
- <i class="fad fa-utensils"></i> **FOOD** <i class="fad fa-utensils"></i>
- <i class="fal fa-turtle"></i> Main / Longest Game
- <i class="fal fa-duck"></i> Short / Medium Games

Again, this is flexible.
