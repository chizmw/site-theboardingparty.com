*Copper Row Gamers* is a work-based, private, gaming group.

The group is hosted outside the office infrastructure to make it simpler to
communicate across the digital boundaries that exist within the office.

## When Does The Group Meet?

### <i class="fad fa-calendar-day"></i> Lunchtime Gaming

* Every weekday. 12:30-13:30. First Floor Cafe - Cooperage

This is a great time to wander by and meet people on a whim.

Due to the constraints of it being lunchtime we naturally pick quicker, easier,
simpler games. These games are a great way to learn some of the basics and meet
some of the awesome people in the group.

### <i class="fad fa-calendar-day"></i> Tuesday Evening Sessions [<i class="fad fa-external-link"></i>][crg-tuesday-evening]

* Every Tuesday. 18:00-whenever. Outside First Floor Cafe - Cooperage

This is our opportunity to play longer, more involved games.

This does **not** exclude new gamers as there are numerous "easy" games that we
can play that wouldn't normally fit into a lunchtime session.

Joining an evening session takes a little more effort than just turning up.

### <i class="fad fa-calendar-day"></i> Irregular Gaming Sessions

*  Whenever we like. Wherever we choose.

These tend to be very similar to the Tuesday Evening Sessions .... but on a
different day of the week.

For example, sometimes we decide that it would be nice to hang out after work
on Friday evenings, with a specific game in mind for the session.
